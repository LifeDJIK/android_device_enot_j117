         If true, this means that the device supports circuit-switched

         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.

         Note: this flag is subtly different from the

         receiving sms via the telephony network.
         This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't send and receive sms message.

         Note: Disable SMS also disable voicemail waiting sms,
               cell broadcasting sms, and MMS. -->
